VNN WEEKEND PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE

Data Source: Varvee.com

Congratulations on being selected to take the VNN Programming Challenge! This challenge is

intended to test your programming chops over a single weekend and, should you survive, it will

give you ample opportunity to showcase your skills.

It is more important you prove that the end­to­end system is up and running accurately than it is to

make the system beautiful to look at.

PROBLEM:

VNN wants to keep track of the leaderboard of top basketball players in Indiana. VNN has asked

you to create a web app called “High Fiver” that dynamically shows users the top five scorers in

Indiana Boys Basketball, and gives users the ability to see game­by­game scoring information

about any of those players in a very simple format.

Your mission is to build the High Fiver app. Rough wireframes are attached.

USER STORIES:

1. Users should dynamically see the top 5 players in Indiana basketball, ranked based on

their scoring average.

a. http://www.varvee.com/team/individual_leaderboard/54/27/

2. When a user clicks on a player, she should see a breakdown of that player's statistics by

game throughout the season. These stats include only: Points, team points, W/L

3. Users should see a graph that shows how many points the player has scored each game,

plotted against how many points their team has scored in the same game.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. All info must be screen scraped dynamically from Varvee for every page load on High

Fiver.

NON­FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Unit tests should be written for Varvee.com parsing logic when getting info

2. Application must be created in a third­party PHP web framework or Ruby on Rails

TESTING STRATEGY:

Before releasing the High Fiver app to the world, VNN will want to ensure that it is a

production­ready application. To that end, please describe your strategy for system testing (using

Selenium or whatever toolset with which you’re most comfortable).

BONUS CHALLENGE:

Build a system test around using the High Fiver app.
